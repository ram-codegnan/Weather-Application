# Weather-Application
This is a full-stack weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions in a specific location. The application fetches weather data from an external API and displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity for the selected location.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end Framework: React
- Back-end Framework: Node.js with Express
- External API: [Weather API Provider Name]

## Features

- User-friendly interface with a search bar to input the location.
- Real-time weather data retrieval for the specified location.
- Display of current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.

### Set up API Key

Before running the application, you need to obtain an API key from the [Weather API Provider Name] (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and set it up in the back-end code.

1. Go to [Weather API Provider Website] and sign up for an account to obtain an API key.

2. In the `server/server.js` file, replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key from the provider:

### javascript
// server/server.js

// Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from the provider
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Running the Application
